Branches in GitHub are parallel versions of a repository. They allow developers to work on different features, fixes, or experiments independently without affecting the main codebase.
Branches are important because they enable;
Isolated Development- Work on new features or bug fixes without disturbing the main project.
Collaboration- Multiple developers can work on different tasks simultaneously.
Version Management- Easily test and review changes before merging them into the main branch.
Creating a branch- git checkout -b hello-world, this code creates and switches to a new branch named hello-world.
Making changes involves editing and addition of files, codes used :git add .
git commit -m "Add hello world feature"
Pushing branch to github we use the code ;git push -u origin hello-world
Creating a Pull Request-On GitHub, navigate to your repository.Click on the "Pull requests" tab.Click "New pull request", select the hello-world branch, and create the pull request.
Merging the Branch-Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, click "Merge pull request".Confirm the merge and delete the branch if it's no longer needed.

Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub that allows developers to automate workflows directly within their GitHub repositories. It enables the creation of custom software development life cycle (SDLC) workflows, such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD).
Continuous Integration- Automatically build and test code changes to ensure they donâ€™t break the application.
Continuous Deployment- Automatically deploy applications to production or other environments after passing tests.
Custom Workflows- Automate repetitive tasks, such as code formatting, dependency management, and notifications.
Example of a CI/CD pipeline;
In your repository, create a directory named .github/workflows. Inside the .github/workflows directory, create a YAML/workflow file; ci-cd-pipeline.yml. bellow is a code:
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Deploy to production
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && success()
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to production..."
The actions above in code perform the following;
on: push- Trigger the workflow when there is a push to the main branch.
on: pull_request- Trigger the workflow for pull requests targeting the main branch.
Jobs:
build- A job that runs on the ubuntu-latest environment.
Checkout Code-uses the actions/checkout action to checkout the repository code.
Set Up Node.js - uses the actions/setup-node action to set up Node.js version 14.
Install Dependencies- runs npm install to install project dependencies.
